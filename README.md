The Software Citation Tools are a package of tools written in JavaScript and with the core library made available through the npm JavaScript package manager. The main part of the package will be a library which will create a citation when given a link to a GitHub repository. Further tools will be created on top of this library to make using this library easier and extend its usefulness.

##About the Project
Software Citation Tools is a project proposed and overseen by Mozilla Science Lab via Abigail Cabunoc Mayes and headed by a senior project team at The Rochester Institute of Technology's Software Engineering Department. The purpose of Software Citation Tools is to provide some tools that use the ideas shown in the [Software Citation Principles](https://www.force11.org/software-citation-principles) paper by FORCE11 to make software citation easier and more frequent in academia.

Even though the team heading the project is doing this as a senior project, anyone is free to contribute! The RIT Software Engineering department has given approval for anyone to help out in any way without affecting the team's grade. Please feel free to contribute in any way you want!

##Contributing
We encourage you to contribute to this project in any way you can! An important goal of this project is to foster a community around these tools.
