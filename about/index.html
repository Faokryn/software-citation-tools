<h1 class="text-center">About the Tools</h1>
<p class="text-justify">
    Software has become increasingly important in modern research, yet it's rarely acknowledged or cited.  By building tools that make it easier to cite software, we can give more credit to research code.  The Software Citation Tools suite aims to fulfill this need by providing researchers and other academics with tools to help generate citations for software.  It will include a module to allowing researchers to input a software repositiry and generate a citation for that software, as well as other tools utilizing the module.

    The Software Citation Tools are being developed as open source software, following open source best practices.  See <a href="../contribute">Contributing</a> for more details.
