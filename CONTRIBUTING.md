# Contributing

We encourage you to contribute to this project in any way you can! An important goal of this project is to foster a community around these tools. If you'd like to be a part of that community, consider contributing in one of these ways:

## Discussion

Discussion gives us invaluable information about the project's requirements and goals. If you would like to contribute to the ongoing discussion of the project's direction and future goals, join the conversation on the relevant [Discussion Issue][discussionIssues], create a [new Issue][newIssue] for your discussion topic, or strike up a conversation in the project's [Gitter chat room][gitter].

## Bug Reports and Feature Requests

This project uses GitHub Issues to track work tickets. If you would like to report a bug or formally request a feature, please [create an Issue][newIssue]. Include as much detail as you can in your ticket, but don't worry! If the team needs more information, we'll ask. If you open an Issue, please participate in the discussion as the team formalizes the ticket so that we can make sure we're capturing your intent accurately.

## Code Contributions

We welcome code contributions to this project! If you would like to contribute by developing for this project, please select a work ticket that is in the "Ready" state from the [Issues page][issues].

When you have successfully implemented the feature described by the work ticket, please [squash][squashGitDoc] the relevant commits into one feature commit, include the issue number in the commit message, and issue a pull request to the development branch of the project. The team will review your pull request, and may ask clarifying questions or request changes- please actively participate in discussion. Once the team has approved your pull request, your contributions will be merged!
